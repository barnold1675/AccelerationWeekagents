## Translation Score: 8.5 / 10.0

**Definition**: How accurately the PRD captures the Jira Epic requirements

### What was translated well

- **Target Users**: All four user segments from Epic captured accurately (New prospective customers, Returning users, Researchers, Competitors)
- **User Constraints**: All five constraints from Epic translated with full fidelity (No user identification, Market selection, No pricing access, No personalization, Value communication challenge)
- **Business Goals**: All four goals from Epic captured (Drive registration, Inspire exploration, Build credibility, Leverage existing components)
- **Registration Sub-goals**: Both sub-goals translated (Benefits clarity, Friction timing)
- **Exploration Sub-goals**: All four sub-goals captured (SGWS assortment, Key categories, Supplier/Level ads, SGWS goals via merchandising)
- **Credibility Goals**: Both trust-building aspects captured (Trusted distributor, Corporate positioning)
- **Module Reuse Strategy**: Requirement to leverage authenticated homepage modules captured
- **Problems to Solve**: All four problems translated (Age gate, Login access, Account creation, Product discovery)
- **Strategic Alignment**: Objective 3 alignment preserved per Epic

### Deductions (-1.5 points)

- **Missing specific friction point strategy** (-0.5): Epic mentions "Thoughtful timing of friction points to drive registration (i.e. create an account to see pricing)" - PRD mentions this concept but doesn't elaborate on specific friction point implementation strategies
- **Competitor experience specifics** (-0.3): Epic doesn't provide guidance on competitor treatment; PRD assumes "limited but impressive experience" which may need validation
- **Acceptance Criteria absent** (-0.4): Epic lacks formal acceptance criteria, so PRD had to infer requirements - these inferences need stakeholder validation
- **No explicit success metric targets in Epic** (-0.3): PRD appropriately marked as TBD but cannot validate against source targets

## Value Score: 8.2 / 10.0

**Definition**: How well the PRD demonstrates business value

### Component Breakdown

| Component | Weight | Score | Assessment |
|-----------|--------|-------|------------|
| VOC Alignment | 30% | 9.0 | Excellent integration of VOC data; quantified pain points (45% speed, 35% functionality, 32% usability) directly inform requirements; 5 customer quotes with attribution; VOC-driven design imperatives clearly articulated; mobile-first (65% users) addressed |
| Revenue Impact | 25% | 7.5 | Registration conversion as primary goal clearly drives revenue; however, specific conversion lift targets not quantified; basket size and LTV impacts not explicitly stated; assumes registration leads to orders without quantifying funnel |
| Strategic Fit | 20% | 8.5 | Strong alignment with Objective 3; supports customer acquisition strategy; leverages existing modules for efficiency; connected to related epics (Search V2, OOS Recommendation, Merch Module) |
| Efficiency Gains | 15% | 8.0 | Module reuse strategy reduces development cost; performance optimization may reduce support tickets related to speed complaints; authentication improvements reduce friction-related support; no quantified cost savings |
| Competitive Edge | 10% | 7.5 | Addresses platform perception issues that create competitive disadvantage; builds credibility as trusted distributor; limited competitive differentiation articulated beyond performance excellence |

### Weighted Score Calculation
- VOC Alignment: 9.0 x 0.30 = 2.70
- Revenue Impact: 7.5 x 0.25 = 1.88
- Strategic Fit: 8.5 x 0.20 = 1.70
- Efficiency Gains: 8.0 x 0.15 = 1.20
- Competitive Edge: 7.5 x 0.10 = 0.75
- **Total: 8.23** (rounded to 8.2)

## Improvement Recommendations

### To improve Translation Score

1. **Clarify friction point strategy** (15 min): Document specific touchpoints where "create account to see pricing" prompts will appear; get stakeholder validation on friction timing approach

2. **Add acceptance criteria** (30 min): Work with Epic owner to define explicit acceptance criteria for each goal; translate to testable requirements

3. **Validate competitor experience assumption** (20 min): Confirm with stakeholders whether competitors should see intentionally limited experience or same experience as prospects

### To improve Value Score

1. **Quantify registration conversion target** (30 min): Work with Analytics to establish baseline and target conversion rates; estimate revenue impact of X% conversion improvement

2. **Add LTV projection** (45 min): Estimate average customer LTV to demonstrate value of each registration; calculate expected revenue based on conversion targets

3. **Quantify support ticket reduction** (20 min): Work with Support to baseline current homepage/performance-related tickets; project reduction from improvements

4. **Articulate competitive differentiation** (30 min): Document specific ways the unauthenticated homepage will differentiate SGWS from competitors beyond performance

## Human Review Needed

**Critical** (45 min total):
- **Product Owner**: Validate friction point timing strategy and "sneak peek" vs gated content balance
- **Engineering Lead**: Confirm <2 second performance target is achievable with planned module reuse; validate performance budget
- **Legal/Compliance**: Confirm age gate implementation requirements

**Optional** (30 min total):
- **Marketing**: Review value proposition messaging and registration benefit highlights
- **Analytics**: Validate proposed metrics framework and establish baseline targets
- **UX Lead**: Review VOC-driven design imperatives for feasibility

## Summary

The PRD demonstrates strong translation of Epic requirements with excellent VOC integration. The 45% site performance and 32% usability pain points are directly addressed through specific requirements (sub-2-second load time, mobile-first design). The primary gap is quantified revenue impact - while registration conversion is the clear goal, specific targets and LTV projections would strengthen the business case.

Key strengths:
- Comprehensive VOC integration with customer quotes
- Clear performance requirements driven by customer feedback
- Strong alignment with Epic goals and constraints
- Appropriate TBD markers for external agent sections

Key gaps to address:
- Friction point implementation strategy needs elaboration
- Revenue projections need quantification
- Acceptance criteria need stakeholder definition
