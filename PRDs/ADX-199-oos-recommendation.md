## 2. Background / Context

### Business Problem

When products are out of stock (OOS) on the SGProof platform, customers face a poor experience that leads to abandoned purchases and lost revenue. The current system lacks intelligent substitution capabilities, resulting in:

1. **No data when OOS**: Lack of real-time inventory data or historical substitution patterns makes it hard to recommend alternatives.
2. **Poor replacement suggestions**: Current logic relies on basic category matching, which doesn't consider user preferences, price range, or brand affinity.
3. **Limited brand introduction**: Customers rarely discover new brands because recommendations are not optimized for cross-brand exposure.
4. **Customer frustration**: When an item is unavailable, users may abandon the purchase instead of exploring alternatives.

This initiative aims to transform OOS situations from lost sales opportunities into discovery moments that maintain customer satisfaction and drive revenue through intelligent, personalized recommendations.

### 2.1 Voice of Customer (VOC) Insights

## 3. Target Users

### Primary Segments

> _Define who you're designing for:_

* **Segment A: Returning B2B Buyers** - Established customers with purchase history who have developed brand preferences and price expectations. They need quick alternatives that match their usual buying patterns and budget adherence requirements.

* **Segment B: Manufacturers/Brand Partners** - Stakeholders interested in cross-brand exposure and introducing their products to customers who typically purchase competitor items. They benefit from intelligent recommendation placement.

* **Segment C: Time-Constrained Operators** - Restaurant/bar managers making quick restocking decisions who cannot afford operational delays. They need immediate, relevant alternatives to avoid service disruptions.

### User Behavior / Intent

> _Describe how these users currently behave and what their intent is:_

**Current Behavior:**
- Users search for specific products by brand, type, or SKU
- When encountering OOS items, users either abandon purchase or manually search for alternatives
- B2B buyers have strict price ranges and may reject suggestions outside their usual spend
- Many customers prefer familiar brands, making new brand introduction challenging
- Bulk purchasing decisions require consideration of pack sizes and case quantities

**User Intent:**
- Find suitable replacements quickly to prevent lost sales and operational delays
- Maintain budget adherence while exploring alternatives
- Discover new brands only when they feel relevant and trustworthy
- Complete orders efficiently without extensive manual searching
- Ensure compatibility with existing order quantities and delivery schedules

## 4. Objective / Goals

_What are we trying to achieve?_

* **Business Goals:**
  - Reduce cart abandonment rate when OOS items are encountered
  - Increase conversion rate on OOS product pages by 25%
  - Introduce new brands to customers, increasing brand diversity in orders by 15%
  - Capture revenue that would otherwise be lost to OOS situations
  - Improve customer retention through better shopping experience

* **Success Metrics:**
  - OOS page conversion rate (target: 25% of users add recommended alternative to cart)
  - Alternative product click-through rate (target: 40% of users view at least one recommendation)
  - Recommendation acceptance rate by category
  - Revenue recovered from OOS situations
  - Customer satisfaction scores on OOS experience (target: 7+/10)

## 9. Risks & Considerations

| Risk / Assumption | Impact | Mitigation |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Recommendation algorithm adds latency | High - Will worsen existing speed complaints | Implement aggressive caching, pre-compute recommendations for popular items, set strict performance SLAs |
| Recommendations feel irrelevant or random | High - Erodes customer trust in platform | A/B test algorithm versions, gather explicit feedback, allow users to dismiss/rate suggestions |
| Insufficient historical data for new users | Medium - Cold start problem for recommendations | Fall back to category-based popularity rankings, prompt users to set preferences |
| Inventory data latency causes stale recommendations | Medium - Suggest items that are also OOS | Real-time inventory sync, validate availability before displaying, show confidence indicators |
| Brand partners concerned about competitor recommendations | Medium - Relationship risk | Develop clear recommendation policies, allow brand-specific rules, offer premium placement options |
| Users bypass recommendations entirely | Low - Feature goes unused | Prominent placement, compelling value props, personalization to increase relevance |
| Mobile performance on recommendation widgets | Medium - Given existing mobile app complaints | Mobile-first design, lazy loading, limit initial recommendations shown |

## 12. Open Questions

|  | **Question** | **Notes** |
| --- | --- | --- |
| 1 | What is the minimum similarity score threshold for showing recommendations? | Need data science input on algorithm tuning |
| 2 | How many alternative products should be shown per OOS item? | UX testing needed - balance between choice and overwhelm |
| 3 | Should we allow merchandising team to manually curate recommendations? | Business process decision - affects scalability |
| 4 | What happens when all alternatives are also OOS? | Edge case handling - show waitlist option? |
| 5 | How do we handle price-sensitive recommendations for accounts with negotiated pricing? | Need to integrate with pricing engine |
| 6 | Should manufacturers be able to pay for premium placement in recommendations? | Revenue opportunity but may affect trust |
| 7 | What is the SLA for recommendation response time? | Performance architecture decision |
| 8 | How will this integrate with existing "Similar Items" functionality if any? | Technical discovery needed |
