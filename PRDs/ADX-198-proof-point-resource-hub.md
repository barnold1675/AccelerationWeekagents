### Executive Summary

This PRD defines requirements for a unified, modern resource hub that serves as the central destination for SGWS customers to access enablement content, support materials, learning resources, product releases, and platform messaging. The initiative addresses the growing need for streamlined customer communication and self-service capabilities as SGWS scales its digital platform and customer base.

---

## 2. Background / Context

### Business Problem Statement

As SGWS continues to scale its digital platform, support operations, onboarding processes, and customer retention efforts, multiple critical pain points have emerged:

1. **Fragmented Information Architecture**: Customers currently navigate disparate sources to find enablement content, support materials, release information, and product messaging. This fragmentation creates friction, increases support burden, and delays time-to-value.

2. **Inefficient Communication Channels**: Over-reliance on email campaigns, WalkMe in-app guidance, and direct support channels has created communication fatigue and inconsistent message delivery. Customers miss critical updates, and support teams are overwhelmed with repetitive inquiries.

3. **Scaling Challenges**: As the customer base grows, the current support model does not scale effectively. Each new feature release or platform update generates a spike in support tickets and calls that could be prevented through better self-service resources.

4. **Competitive Pressure**: With recent industry developments (including Provi news), there is increased pressure to demonstrate platform value, thought leadership, and customer-centric innovation.

5. **Inconsistent Messaging**: Without a single source of truth, different teams communicate platform updates differently, creating confusion and undermining trust.

### Strategic Alignment

This initiative aligns with several key strategic priorities:

- **Customer Experience Excellence**: Improving the overall customer journey by reducing friction and enabling self-service
- **Operational Efficiency**: Reducing support costs and freeing up resources for higher-value activities
- **Platform Adoption**: Accelerating feature adoption and driving consistent usage patterns
- **Brand Positioning**: Establishing SGWS as a customer-centric thought leader in the industry
- **Revenue Protection**: Reducing churn through improved customer satisfaction and faster time-to-value
