## 2. Background / Context

### Business Problem

As Southern Glazer's Wine & Spirits continues to scale, support, onboard, and retain customers, there is a critical and growing need for a **unified and modern resource hub** where customers can access enablement, support, and learning content along with the latest releases, functionality updates, and messaging.

Currently, customers face significant friction points:
- **Fragmented information sources**: Content scattered across email, WalkMe, and multiple support channels
- **Inconsistent messaging**: Competing and conflicting messages on platform updates
- **Limited self-service options**: Customers cannot independently troubleshoot or learn platform features
- **Support burden**: High volume of support tickets and calls for issues customers could resolve themselves
- **Slow onboarding**: New customers lack standardized, accessible content to get up to speed quickly

This initiative directly supports 2026 prioritization and roadmap enablement, with particular strategic importance given recent Provi news and the need to reinforce SGWS's position as a tech innovator and thought leader.
