# AI-Powered Product Management
## A 3-Day Proof of Concept | November 18-21, 2025

---

## Why This Matters

### The Challenge We Face

Every product initiative starts with a PRD. Today, creating one takes **2-5 days** of PM time—time spent gathering requirements, searching for customer feedback, and formatting documents instead of **strategic thinking**.

### What If We Could Change That?

What if a PM could go from a Jira ticket to a complete, customer-validated PRD in **5 minutes**?

That's what we built this week.

---

## The Investment Case

### Quick Numbers

| Before | After | Impact |
|--------|-------|--------|
| 2-5 days per PRD | 5 minutes per PRD | **95% time savings** |
| Customer feedback scattered | Auto-integrated quotes | **100% evidence-based** |
| Subjective quality reviews | Objective scoring | **Measurable quality** |
| Inconsistent formats | Standard template | **Zero format debates** |

### ROI This Week Alone

- **5 PRDs generated** in 3 days
- **77-197 hours saved** (vs manual creation)
- **2-5 weeks of PM capacity** freed up

### Day 1: Tuesday — Built the Foundation

**What we did**: Created 5 AI assistants, each specialized in a different part of product management

**Why it matters**: Instead of one generic tool, we have experts that hand off work to each other—like a well-coordinated team

**Result**: System ready to generate PRDs

---

### Day 2: Wednesday — Generated First PRDs

**What we did**: Produced 4 complete PRDs for real initiatives

| PRD | Initiative |
|-----|------------|
| ADX-196 | Unauthenticated Homepage |
| ADX-197 | Search V2 |
| ADX-198 | Proof Point Resource Hub |
| ADX-199 | OOS Recommendation |

**Why it matters**: Proved the system works with real Jira tickets

**Result**: 4 PRDs with customer feedback automatically integrated

---

### Day 3: Thursday — Refined Quality Scoring

**What we did**:
- Created ADX-201 (Digital Sommelier) PRD
- Redesigned quality scoring based on business value
- Re-generated ADX-196 with improved system

**Why it matters**: Quality is now measurable—every PRD gets scored on:

| Score | What It Measures | Why Executives Care |
|-------|------------------|---------------------|
| **Translation** | Did we capture requirements correctly? | No missed requirements |
| **Value** | Is this worth building? | Investment justified |

**Result**: PRDs with objective quality scores (8.5/10 avg)

---

```

### How Quality Is Measured

Every PRD gets two scores (out of 10):

| Score | Simple Question | What "Good" Looks Like |
|-------|-----------------|------------------------|
| **Translation** | "Did we capture everything from the ticket?" | 8+ means nothing was missed |
| **Value** | "Is this worth building?" | 8+ means strong business case |

**Value considers 5 things**: Customer need (30%), Revenue potential (25%), Strategic alignment (20%), Efficiency gains (15%), Competitive advantage (10%)

**Threshold**: Both scores must be 7+ or the PRD goes back for improvement

## What We Learned

### What Makes This Work

| Insight | Why It Matters |
|---------|----------------|
| **Specialization wins** | 5 focused tools beat 1 generic tool |
| **Customer data is key** | Real quotes make PRDs actionable |
| **Scores drive improvement** | "8.5" is better than "looks good" |

### What We Improved Along the Way

- Started with basic output → Added quality scoring
- Started with technical scores → Shifted to business value
- Started with complex formats → Simplified to readable markdown

### What Each Week Unlocks

| Week | What Gets Built | Business Outcome |
|------|-----------------|------------------|
| **Week 1** ✅ | PRD generation + scoring | Ideas → Documented requirements |
| **Week 2** | Story creation + launch planning | Requirements → Sprint-ready work |
| **Week 3** | Quality dashboards + automation | Manual triggers → Self-running |
| **Week 4** | Full integration | Jira ticket → Sprint ticket, automated |

### Investment Required

| Phase | Effort | Return |
|-------|--------|--------|
| This week (done) | 3 days setup | 5 PRDs, 77-200 hours saved |
| Next week | 1 day | Every PRD auto-creates user stories |
| Week 3-4 | 2 days | System runs automatically, scales infinitely |

**Total investment**: ~1 week of setup
**Ongoing cost**: Near zero (runs itself)
