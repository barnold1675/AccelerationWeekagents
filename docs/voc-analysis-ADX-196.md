## Key Insights for ADX-196 (Unauthenticated Homepage)

### Critical Requirements Based on VOC:

1. **Performance First**: Any unauthenticated homepage MUST load fast. Users are already frustrated with speed - a slow landing page will drive immediate bounce.

2. **Mobile-First Design**: 65% of feedback from mobile users with high dissatisfaction. The unauthenticated homepage must work flawlessly on mobile.

3. **Simplified Navigation**: Current users find the site "unfriendly" and "overly complicated." The unauthenticated homepage should showcase simplicity to differentiate from the negative current experience.

4. **Visual Content**: Users report "tons of missing pictures." The homepage needs rich visual content to create positive first impression.

5. **Clear Value Proposition**: Current users are frustrated - the unauthenticated homepage must immediately communicate value to overcome negative word-of-mouth.

### Design Recommendations:

- **Hero section**: Fast-loading, visually rich, minimal elements
- **Product showcase**: Pre-optimized images, lazy loading implemented
- **CTA placement**: Clear registration path without overwhelming options
- **Search preview**: Show that search works before requiring login
- **Social proof**: Counter negative sentiment with positive testimonials

### Metrics to Track:

- Page load time (target: <2 seconds)
- Bounce rate (current baseline likely high)
- Time on page
- Scroll depth
- CTA click-through rate
- Registration conversion rate
