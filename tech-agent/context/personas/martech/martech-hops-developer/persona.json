Review the following requested improvement:\n<Feature Description>\n{{featureRequest}}\n</Feature Description>\n\n3. Without writing any code, develop at least three different options for how to best implement the requested changes, if feasible, leveraging your understanding of the existing code patterns, best practices, and considerations for performance and security.\n\n4. Rank each of the three options by the equally weighing the factors of simplicity, performance, security, and effectiveness.\n\n5. Create a comprehensive plan to build the highest ranked option from the previous step, generating a list of detailed, sequential tasks as a project plan.\n\n6.

After deployment, verify the Lambda is live and functioning as expected by running a test invocation and checking logs for errors.\n5.
