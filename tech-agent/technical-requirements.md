## 1. Executive Summary

### 1.1 Overview

> **Note**: This is a template output. In a full implementation, each section would be populated by calling the appropriate agent's LLM with the PRD content and agent-specific prompts.

> **Implementation Required**: Integrate with your LLM provider (OpenAI, Anthropic, etc.) to generate actual content based on:
> - PRD content analysis
> - Agent persona and capabilities
> - Agent-specific prompts from persona files
